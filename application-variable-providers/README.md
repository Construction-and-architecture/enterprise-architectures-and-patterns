# Application Variable Providers

Loading application variables from external systems is a common practice. Besides using the Environment Variable Provider, Spin allows you to load application variables using either the Vault Provider or the Azure Key Vault Provider

See examples for the corresponding Application Variable Providers in [`vault-provider`](./vault-provider/) and [`azure-key-vault-provider](./azure-key-vault-provider/)
