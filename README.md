# Enterprise Architectures & Patterns

This repository contains a collection of enterprise architectures and patterns, to illustrate the potential of [Spin](https://github.com/fermyon/spin) and WebAssembly (Wasm) for building real-world applications

Each folder contains a self-contained example, including a high-level explanation of the pattern/architecture and instructions on how to build and run the particular Spin App(s).

## Getting Started with Spin

If you haven't used Spin before, we highly recommend exploring the [Fermyon Developer Home](https://developer.fermyon.com) to get started. There you'll find everything from installing Spin on your local machine, over language-specific guides, to advanced techniques when building serverless Wasm applications.
